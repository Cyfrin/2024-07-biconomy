# **Biconomy Smart Contract Optimization Bounty Program**

## **Introduction**

Biconomy is dedicated to enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of our decentralized ecosystem. Through our **Smart Contract Optimization Bounty Program**, we invite global developers to contribute towards optimizing gas efficiency across our suite of smart contracts. This initiative is key to reducing operational costs, improving scalability, and elevating the user experience within the blockchain ecosystem.

For details on reporting security vulnerabilities or contributing to our project in other ways, please see our [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) files. We value all contributions that enhance the Biconomy ecosystem, including but not limited to code optimizations and security improvements.

## **Program Objective**

Our goal is to maximize gas efficiency in our smart contracts while ensuring the code remains **readable, maintainable, and thoroughly documented**.We value contributions that find the perfect harmony between optimization and clarity, as both are critical for the enduring success of blockchain projects.

## **Rewards Structure**

Contributors to the Biconomy Smart Contract Optimization Bounty Program will be rewarded for their efforts with **BICO tokens (ERC20)**, based on the cumulative gas savings achieved across all contracts. Furthermore, in addition to the bounty rewards, successful contributors will gain a spot in our **Contributor Hall of Fame**, where names or GitHub handles are honored within our repository and documentation, showcasing the impactful contributions made to the Biconomy ecosystem.

### **Reward Tiers**

- **Tier 1 (up to 10% Cumulative Gas Savings):** Receive $150 in BICO tokens for optimizing up to 10%.
- **Tier 2 (11-25% Cumulative Gas Savings):** Earn $600 in BICO tokens for achieving 11-25% savings.
- **Tier 3 (26-40% Cumulative Gas Savings):** Secure $2,000 in BICO tokens for 26-40% cumulative savings.
- **Tier 4 (41-55% Cumulative Gas Savings):** Gain $4,000 in BICO tokens for optimizing 41-55%.
- **Tier 5 (over 55% Cumulative Gas Savings):** Be rewarded with $7,500 in BICO tokens for surpassing 55% savings.

## **Submission Guidelines**

### **Identifying Opportunities**

- Explore our smart contracts for potential gas optimization areas.

### **Implementing Changes**

- **Fork the `develop` branch** of the Biconomy repository. This ensures your updates are built on the latest features and fixes, preventing overlap with existing main branch plans.
- Maintain code clarity and documentation through your optimizations.

### **Testing and Validation**

- Validate your optimizations with thorough testing, ensuring both gas efficiency improvement and preserved functionality.
- Attach detailed test results with your submission.

### **Submitting Your Work**

- Open a pull request (PR) from your forked **develop branch**, detailing your changes, the rationale behind each optimization, and its gas usage impact.
- Highlight the cumulative gas savings achieved across all functions and contracts.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

Submissions will be evaluated on:

- **Efficiency Improvement:** The cumulative percentage of gas savings.
- **Code Quality:** Enhancements should bolster clarity, maintainability, and documentation.
- **Innovation:** Creative solutions to optimization challenges.
- **Impact:** The significant contribution to the project's efficiency and sustainability.

## **Eligibility Criteria**

- Originality is a must, with no infringement on third-party rights.
- Include comprehensive documentation of optimizations and their impacts.
- Demonstrated effectiveness of optimizations with accompanying tests.
- Adherence to smart contract development and security best practices is required.

## **Terms and Conditions**

- Rewards, payable in BICO tokens, will be based on their USD value at distribution.
- Biconomy reserves the right to alter the program's terms or discontinue at its discretion.
- Reward tiers will be determined by the Biconomy team based on the evaluation criteria.

This program is a unique opportunity for developers to showcase their expertise, contribute to a more efficient ecosystem, and earn rewards for their innovative solutions. We eagerly anticipate your contributions and the enhancements your optimizations will bring to our smart contracts.

**We look forward to your innovative contributions and collectively advancing the efficiency of decentralized applications!**
